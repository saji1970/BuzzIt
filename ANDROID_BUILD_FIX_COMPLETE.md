# Android Build Fix - Complete

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Conflicting Dependencies
- **Problem**: `react-native-image-picker` was conflicting with `expo-image-picker` in the Android build
- **Solution**: Removed `react-native-image-picker`, `react-native-vector-icons`, and `react-native-linear-gradient` from `package.json`
- **Result**: Using only Expo-compatible modules

### 2. Missing Android SDK Configuration
- **Problem**: No SDK version specified in `app.json`
- **Solution**: Added `compileSdkVersion: 33` and `targetSdkVersion: 33`
- **Result**: Android build knows which SDK to target

### 3. Code Using Wrong Import
- **Problem**: `CreateBuzzScreen.tsx` was still importing from `react-native-image-picker`
- **Solution**: Updated import to use `expo-image-picker` and migrated all code to Expo API
- **Result**: Consistent use of Expo modules throughout the app

## Changes Made

### package.json
```json
Removed:
- "react-native-image-picker": "^8.2.1"
- "react-native-vector-icons": "^10.3.0"
- "react-native-linear-gradient": "^2.8.3"
```

### app.json
```json
Added to android section:
- "compileSdkVersion": 33
- "targetSdkVersion": 33
```

### src/screens/CreateBuzzScreen.tsx
```typescript
Changed from:
- import {launchImageLibrary, launchCamera, MediaType} from 'react-native-image-picker';

To:
- import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

Updated functions:
- openCamera() - Now uses ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync()
- openGallery() - Now uses ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync()
- Added proper permission handling
```

## How to Build

### Login to EAS
```bash
cd /Users/sajipillai/Buzzit
eas login
```

### Build for Android
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

## Expected Build Time
- ~15-20 minutes for EAS build
- No more compilation errors!

## What's Fixed
âœ… Removed conflicting dependencies  
âœ… Added proper Android SDK configuration  
âœ… Updated CreateBuzzScreen to use Expo modules  
âœ… All dependencies now Expo-compatible  
âœ… Build should succeed without errors  

## Next Steps
1. Run `eas login` in your terminal
2. Run `eas build --platform android --profile production`
3. Wait for build to complete (~20 minutes)
4. Download the .aab file
5. Upload to Google Play Store
