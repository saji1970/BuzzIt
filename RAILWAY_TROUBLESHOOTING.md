# Railway Deployment Issue - 502 Error

## Current Status
- Server logs show: "ðŸ”¥ Buzz it Backend API running on port 3000"
- Server is binding to 0.0.0.0:3000 (correct)
- Railway returns 502 "Application failed to respond"

## Possible Causes
1. **Wrong Root Directory**: Railway might be trying to run the Expo app instead of the backend
2. **Port Configuration**: Railway might not be forwarding traffic correctly
3. **Health Check Failure**: Railway might be health checking the wrong endpoint
4. **Build Configuration**: nixpacks.toml or railway.json might have incorrect settings

## Recommended Actions
1. Go to Railway Dashboard (https://railway.app)
2. Select "Buzz it" project â†’ "BuzzIt" service
3. Check Settings:
   - **Root Directory**: Should be `/server`
   - **Start Command**: Should be `node index.js`
   - **Port**: Should be auto-detected or set to 3000
4. Check if there's a health check endpoint configured
5. Redeploy from dashboard after fixing settings

## Manual Fix Required
The Railway CLI requires interactive login which can't be done programmatically.
You need to manually configure the service through the Railway dashboard.
