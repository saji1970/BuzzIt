# Creating App Icon for Buzzit

## Quick Solution: Use Online Icon Generator

1. Visit: https://www.appicon.co/
2. Upload any image or use the "Buzz" text with fire emoji
3. Download the iOS and Android icons
4. Extract to `assets/` folder

## Temporary Fix - Using Placeholder

For now, you can use a text-based approach or skip the icon for testing.

## For Play Store Deployment

You'll need:
- 512x512px icon (required for Play Store)
