# 🚀 Start EAS Build - Quick Instructions

## ✅ You're Ready to Build!

- **EAS CLI:** Installed ✓
- **Logged in:** sajipillai70 ✓
- **Project configured:** ✓

## 🏗️ Start Your Build

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/sajipillai/Buzzit
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### What to Expect:

1. **Credential Setup (First Time Only):**
   - EAS will ask if you want to generate credentials automatically
   - Answer: `Y` (yes) to let EAS manage certificates
   - You may be prompted for your Apple Developer account info

2. **Build Configuration:**
   - EAS will confirm build settings
   - Review and press Enter to continue

3. **Build Starts:**
   - Build will queue on Expo's servers
   - You'll get a build URL to track progress
   - Estimated time: 15-20 minutes

## 📱 Alternative: Preview Build (No Credentials Needed)

If you want to test without Apple Developer credentials:

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

This creates an internal build for testing.

## 🔍 Monitor Your Build

3. **development** - Development client builds

## ⚡ Quick Commands

```bash
# iOS Production Build

```

## 📝 Notes

- **First build:** Takes longer (~20 minutes), sets up certificates
- **Subsequent builds:** Faster with caching
- **Production builds:** Require Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- **Preview builds:** No credentials needed, perfect for testing
